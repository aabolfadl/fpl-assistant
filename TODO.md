- (Not sure if we should change this) current knowledge graph does not store some features such as `value`, `team_a_score`

- test embedding retrieval, adam said nep4j embeddings format does not look like prompt embeddings format so will this cause a problem?

- use of index in feature embeding vectors (in desc it was for node embeddings only)
